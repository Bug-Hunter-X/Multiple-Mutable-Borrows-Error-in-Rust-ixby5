This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with mutable references in Rust: the multiple mutable borrows error. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create two mutable references to the same variable simultaneously, leading to a compilation failure.  The solution in `bugSolution.rs` showcases how to refactor the code to avoid this error, possibly using techniques like cloning, temporary variables, or altering the overall logic.
